                    <h2>About the La Mesa Library</h2>
                    <p>The La Mesa Library is part of the San Diego County Library System. The City of La Mesa owns the land and the building
                        that the library occupies, while the County of San Diego maintains the library. This cooperative relationship between
                        the city and the county has served the community well over the years by drawing on resources from both public agencies.</p>
                    <p>The County of San Diego budgets for a basic level of staffing and service to all the libraries in the system. In
                        addition, the County Supervisors' Library Materials Matching Fund will match, dollar for dollar, any locally generated
                        financial contributions for additional materials or supplies.</p>
                    <p>The La Mesa Library is one of the most active branches of the La Mesa County Library System. The funds raised by
                        the Friends of the La Mesa Library go a long way toward providing the materials that patrons of the La Mesa Library
                        have long enjoyed.</p>
                    <h2>Friends of the Library Bookstore</h2>
                    <p>The Friends of the La Mesa Library raises the majority of its money from used book sales. Our bookstore is conveniently
                        located just inside the library's front entrance, and is open daily from 1 to 4 PM. Our continued success depends
                        on two thing: your donation of new or gently used books, and volunteers to staff and run the bookstore. If you
                        think you might like to help with our bookstore, please indicate so when you join or renew your membership. all
                        volunteers working in the bookstore and/or the library and required to go through a formal background check by
                        the County.</p>
                    <h2>Future Needs</h2>
                    <p>Because of the high volume of use of the La Mesa branch library building, it is logical that maintenance costs will
                        go up in the years ahead. The Friends of the La Mesa Library has begun a specific savings fund to assist with those
                        improvements when the time comes. If you wish to donate specifically to this effort, you may do so by noting it
                        on the memo line of your donation check.</p>
