    3 nonprofit organization whose stated purpose is to promote, preserve, and support library services and patron
    needs through education and of communication with local libraries and the community.</p>

<h2>Future Needs</h2>
<p>Because of the high volume of use of the La Mesa branch library building, it is logical that maintenance costs will
    go up in the years ahead. The Friends of the La Mesa Library has begun a specific savings fund to assist with those
    improvements when the time comes. If you wish to donate specifically to this effort, you may do so by noting it
    on the memo line of your donation check.</p>
