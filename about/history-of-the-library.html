<h1>About the La Mesa Library</h1>
<p>The La Mesa Library is part of the San Diego County Library System. The City of La Mesa owns the land and the building
    that the library occupies, while the County of San Diego maintains the library. This cooperative relationship between
    the city and the county has served the community well over the years by drawing on resources from both public agencies.</p>
<p>The County of San Diego budgets for a basic level of staffing and service to all the libraries in the system. In
    addition, the County Supervisors' Library Materials Matching Fund will match, dollar for dollar, any locally generated
    financial contributions for additional materials or supplies.</p>
<p>The La Mesa Library is one of the most active branches of the La Mesa County Library System. The funds raised by
    the Friends of the La Mesa Library go a long way toward providing the materials that patrons of the La Mesa Library
    have long enjoyed.</p>
