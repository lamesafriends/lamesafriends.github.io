<p>of the Friends of the La Mesa Library
    <br />*a nonprofit tax-exempt organization</p>
<h2 align="left">Why join the Friends?</h2>
<p align="left">Besides giving back to the community and helping the library maintain its pre-eminent status in circulation, members
    of the Friends rub shoulders with other book lovers, share their knowledge or specialty with bookstore visitors,
    and work in a modern, air-conditioned room visited by friends and neighbors.</p>
<h2 align="left">FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY BOOKSTORE</h2>
<p align="left">The&nbsp;Friends of the La Mesa Library&nbsp;raises the majority of its money from used book sales. Our bookstore
    is conveniently located just inside the library's front entrance, and is open daily from 1 to 4 PM. Our continued
    success depends on two things: your donation of new or gently used books, and volunteers to staff and run the bookstore.
    lf you think you might like to help with our bookstore, please indicate so when you join or renew your membership.
    All volunteers working in the bookstore and/or the library are required to go through a formal background check
    by the County.</p>
