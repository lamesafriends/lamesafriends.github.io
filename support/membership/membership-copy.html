<h2 id="friends-of-the-library-bookstore">FRIENDS OF THE LIBRARY BOOKSTORE</h2>

<p>The Friends of the La Mesa Library raises a majority of its money from used book sales. Our bookstore is conveniently located just inside the library’s front entrance, and is open daily from 1 to 4 PM. Our bookstore’s continued success depends on two things: your donation of new or gently used books, and volunteers to help staff and run the bookstore. lf you’ve always wanted to work in a bookstore, volunteering in ours is a fun and easy opportunity.  Additionally, active bookstore volunteers receive a complimentary membership.  Interested in volunteer opportunities? <a href="mailto:membership@lamesalibrary.org" target="_blank">Let us know!</a></p>
