                        <h2>About the La Mesa Library</h2>
                        <p align="left">The La Mesa Library is part of the San Diego County Library system. The City
                            of La Mesa owns the land and the building that the library occupies, while
                            the County of San Diego operates the library. This cooperative relationship
                            between the City and the County has served the community well over the years
                            by drawing on resources from both public agencies.</p>
                        <p align="left">The County of San Diego budgets for a basic level of staffing and service to
                            all of the libraries in its system. In addition, the County often has matching
                            funds that can match, dollar for dollar, any locally generated financial
                            contributions for additional materials or supplies.</p>
                        <p class="box-info">The La Mesa library is one of the most active branches in the 33 branch County
                            library system. The funds raised by the Friends of the La Mesa Library go
                            a long way toward providing the materials that patrons of the La Mesa library
                            have long enjoyed.</p>

                        <p>March 16, 2017</p>
                        <p>Thank you for taking the time to visit our website and to look for information
                            about the Friends of the La Mesa Library. The first thing you should know
                            is that the Friends of the La Mesa Library, Inc. is a 501(c) (3) non-profit
                            corporation (Tax ID # 33-0638967). All dues and donations are tax deductible
                            to the full extent of the law.</p>
                        <p>The Board of the Friends of the La Mesa Library needs your help! The current
                            board has been in place for over five years and has accomplished a lot. But
                            no volunteer organization can thrive without a constant influx of new people
                            with renewed enthusiasm and new ideas. If you have experience with retail
                            sales, we can use help with the bookstore: sorting, pricing and selling the
                            many books that are so generously donated by our fellow residents. If you
                            have administrative skills, our secretary, membership chair, and treasurer
                            are ready to train and step aside for a new person. Do you have a background
                            in marketing and social media? We could really use your skills in our efforts
                            to promote the Library and the many programs and features offered. If you
                            are interested, please contact me directly at 619-460-1744, by email at
                            <a
                                href="mailto:jcschmitz@hotmail.com">jcschmitz@hotmail.com</a>, or by leaving a message at the bookstore in the
                            Library. If the bookstore is closed, you can leave a message in the Friends
                            donation box in lobby.</p>
                        <p>As I write this message, the City of La Mesa is entering into its annual budget
                            preparation process. This process began with the recent Town Hall meetings
                            at which the City Council received direct input on community issues from
                            the public. Having attended these meetings, it is clear that the major concerns
                            of many residents are the recent influx of marijuana dispensaries and the
                            ongoing struggle with scofflaws in their cars.</p>
                        <p>The next step in this budget process will be City Council workshop meetings during
                            which the City staff will outline La Mesa&rsquo;s current and projected financial
                            situation, along with reports from the various departments on their anticipated
                            work programs. In addition to addressing the expressed concerns of the community,
                            the City is devoting time and effort to the continued revitalization of the
                            La Mesa Village, improvements to the parks and recreational opportunities
                            in the city, and methods and opportunities to complete needed improvements
                            in the La Mesa Civic Center. For over a year and a half, the Friends of the
                            La Mesa Library have reminded the City Council that the current Civic Center
                            Master Plan reflects a commitment made fifteen years ago to provide the residents
                            of La Mesa with a larger and more functional library. We believe that such
                            a building should remain an integral part of any revised vision for the Civic
                            Center.</p>
                        <p>I invite everyone to attend one of the new Second Saturday Concerts in the library.
                            These start at 1:00 p.m. and go for an hour or an hour-and-a-half. They feature
                            acoustic musicians suitable for the library environment. This pilot program
                            is jointly funded by the Friends and the County Library System and will continue
                            through June. It has been so successful that the Friends&rsquo; Board and
                            La Mesa Library staff has agreed to restart the series in September.</p>
                        <p>If you have any questions or comments about how the Friends are doing, please
                            feel free to contact me at&nbsp;

                        <p style="text-align: left;" align="left">The Friends of the La Mesa Library raises the majority of its money from used
                            book sales. Our bookstore is conveniently located just inside the library's
                            front entrance, and is open daily from 1 to 4 PM. Our continued success depends
                            on two things: your donation of new or gently used books, and volunteers
                            to staff and run the bookstore. lf you think you might like to help with
                            our bookstore, please indicate so when you join or renew your membership.
                            All volunteers working in the bookstore and/or the library are required to
                            go through a formal background check by the County.</p>
