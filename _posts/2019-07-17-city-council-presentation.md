On July 9th, La Mesa Library Branch Manager Chelsie Harris gave an update to City Council on whatâ€™s been happening at the library, and she also shared San Diego County Library's initiatives, accomplishments, and their Guiding Principles:
<!--more-->

- **LEARN**.  The library promotes learning, exploration, and discovery for fulfillment and personal growth.  Examples include the forthcoming Kindergarten Gear-Up and existing Library High School.  Two La Mesa residents have graduated from LHS, and four others are enrolled in the program.  
- **ENERGIZE**.  The library champions civic engagement and supports individuals in shaping the future of our community.  Examples include the Citizenship Class series hosted at the library earlier this year; five La Mesa residents completed the program. 
- **READ**.  The library encourages reading in every way: to develop skills, nurture hope, and motivate a love of reading.  Examples include the ability to sign-up for a library card right away, online, and download one of 133K downloadable eBooks.  There are also book clubs for teens and adults, and the quarterly "Coffee & Books" program.
- **CREATE**.  The library designs opportunities for people to experience and enjoy culture and the arts as both creators and participants.  Examples include free training and use of the onsite MakerBot 3D printer, S.T.E.A.M workshops, and the 2nd Saturday concert series.
