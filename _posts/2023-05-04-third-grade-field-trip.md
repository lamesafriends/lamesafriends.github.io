The first library field trip for third grade classes from Rolando Elementary was a great success!

<!--more-->

As third graders in 2023, this the first field trip many of these kids have ever been on due to COVID. That just makes it even more special that we are able to provide this experience for them.

There are at least five more trips planned for the coming weeks.
