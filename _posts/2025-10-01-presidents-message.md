Hello Friends,

I am honored to serve as the new President of the Friends of the La Mesa Library. I have lived in La Mesa for about two and a half years, though I was born and raised in Southern California. One of the things I love most about our city is its walkability and small-town feel, all while being close to the vibrancy of a big city.

Libraries have been a part of my life since my earliest memories. As a child, my family did not have a cable at home, so the library became both my teacher and my entertainment. I remember borrowing VHS tapes of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire musicals from our local mobile library, and spending hours reading books that transported me into new worlds (mostly Nancy Drew). Over the years, the library gave me access to knowledge and resources that fueled my personal and professional growth. Today, I still rely on the library, especially digital audiobooks and e-books, and I continue to be amazed at the wide range of programs and services libraries provide. That is why, when I looked for a way to give back to my community, the Friends of the La Mesa Library felt like the perfect fit.

As I have stepped into this role, I have also reflected on the deep history of our organization. I want to thank the La Mesa Women’s Club for originally founding the Friends of La Mesa Library (back in 1969) and to recognize the many longstanding volunteers who have carried this work forward with such dedication. Their service has made this organization what it is today. I also want to welcome the new members and volunteers who bring fresh energy and ideas. We are stronger together because of all of you.

Looking ahead, the vision I have for the Friends of the La Mesa Library is simple but powerful: to champion growth to empower generations. To guide this work, I am focusing on three strategic pillars:

- **Fuel Growth** – Mobilize funds and partnerships to expand the library and strengthen its future.
- **Ignite Learning** – Build transformative programs that spark curiosity and open possibilities.
- **Build Belonging** – Engage members, empower volunteers, and connect the community in meaningful ways.

I came to these priorities after a two-month listening tour with patrons, librarians, board members, and community members. What I heard was clear: we are doing a great job around Ignite Learning, but we have opportunities to do more with Fuel Growth and Build Belonging. For example, our library lacks core resources that many others have, such as community rooms. As one of our librarians shared with me, “Right now, our library is more like one large multipurpose room.” La Mesa deserves a library that reflects our vibrant and growing community, and the Friends will continue to advocate for that future.

Thank you for being part of this journey. Together, we can ensure that the La Mesa Library remains a place of growth, discovery, and belonging for generations to come.

Warmly,

Kirsten Iversen<br>
Board President,<br>
Friends of the La Mesa Library
