Happy New Year to you all. I am looking forward to the coming year for a variety of reasons. <strong>First and
foremost is that I will be stepping down as President next summer!</strong> I will have served in this
capacity for 14 years and it is time for a fresh perspective. I won’t be leaving the Friends, just stepping
over to be treasurer. If anyone has the time and interest to take over, or to fill another position on the
board, please let me know. My email address is: jcschmitz@hotmail.com.

The following are some other Friends of the La Mesa Library highlights:

- We await news from the City of La Mesa on the response they got when they approached the Postal
Service about moving out of their current location in the Civic Center. If they do, the library can be
expanded into that space. That was the least expensive option from the study the City commissioned
to improve library services to La Mesa. Should the Post Office stay, the alternative would be to add a
second floor to some portion of the existing library space. The City Council was not enthusiastic
about the third option to design and build an entirely new library elsewhere in the Civic Center block.
- This past year a very generous local donor approached the Friends and the library staff with funding
and an admonition to “think big” in terms of programs and activities at our branch. The result of this
donation was to organize field trips for La Mesa’s third graders to visit the library last may. Close to
500 children came to see not only the library, but also the Police and Fire stations and a collection of
Public Works Department heavy equipment. They received string backpacks, library cards and card
holders, books, and helmets. It was so successful that all agreed that this event should continue. The
next session is scheduled to occur at the end of February. In addition to the gifts to the students, the
donated funds also pay the school district for the buses to transport the kids back and forth.
- Our bookstore continues to be our most consistent source of revenue thanks to Robin Theilman and
her wonderful volunteers. We recently installed a new sign over the bookstore door for better
identification. If you would like to help with the bookstore, please leave your contact information
with a bookstore attendant or a library staff member.
