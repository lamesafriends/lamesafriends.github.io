<p>Thank you for taking the time to visit our website and to look for information
    about the Friends of the La Mesa Library. The first thing you should know
    is that the Friends of the La Mesa Library, Inc. is a 501(c) (3) non-profit
    corporation (Tax ID # 33-0638967). All dues and donations are tax deductible
    to the full extent of the law.</p>
<p>The Board of the Friends of the La Mesa Library needs your help! The current
    board has been in place for over five years and has accomplished a lot. But
    no volunteer organization can thrive without a constant influx of new people
    with renewed enthusiasm and new ideas. If you have experience with retail
    sales, we can use help with the bookstore: sorting, pricing and selling the
    many books that are so generously donated by our fellow residents. If you
    have administrative skills, our secretary, membership chair, and treasurer
    are ready to train and step aside for a new person. Do you have a background
    in marketing and social media? We could really use your skills in our efforts
    to promote the Library and the many programs and features offered. If you
    are interested, please contact me directly at 619-460-1744, by email at
    <span id="cloak89645">This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it.</span>, or by leaving a message at the bookstore in the
    Library. If the bookstore is closed, you can leave a message in the Friends
    donation box in lobby.</p>
<p>As I write this message, the City of La Mesa is entering into its annual budget
    preparation process. This process began with the recent Town Hall meetings
    at which the City Council received direct input on community issues from
    the public. Having attended these meetings, it is clear that the major concerns
    of many residents are the recent influx of marijuana dispensaries and the
    ongoing struggle with scofflaws in their cars.</p>
<p>The next step in this budget process will be City Council workshop meetings during
    which the City staff will outline La Mesa&rsquo;s current and projected financial
    situation, along with reports from the various departments on their anticipated
    work programs. In addition to addressing the expressed concerns of the community,
    the City is devoting time and effort to the continued revitalization of the
    La Mesa Village, improvements to the parks and recreational opportunities
    in the city, and methods and opportunities to complete needed improvements
    in the La Mesa Civic Center. For over a year and a half, the Friends of the
    La Mesa Library have reminded the City Council that the current Civic Center
    Master Plan reflects a commitment made fifteen years ago to provide the residents
    of La Mesa with a larger and more functional library. We believe that such
    a building should remain an integral part of any revised vision for the Civic
    Center.</p>
<p>I invite everyone to attend one of the new Second Saturday Concerts in the library.
    These start at 1:00 p.m. and go for an hour or an hour-and-a-half. They feature
    acoustic musicians suitable for the library environment. This pilot program
    is jointly funded by the Friends and the County Library System and will continue
    through June. It has been so successful that the Friends&rsquo; Board and
    La Mesa Library staff has agreed to restart the series in September.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about how the Friends are doing, please
    feel free to contact me at&nbsp;
