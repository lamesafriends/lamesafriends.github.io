More than 40 members, volunteers, and community supporters gathered for our 2025 Friends of the La Mesa Library Member Annual Event. We connected over our shared passion for the La Mesa Library, learned about the latest updates on the library expansion, and shared new ways for members to get involved. The event reminded us how powerful our collective support can be, from helping fund enriching programs to creating opportunities for lifelong learning.
